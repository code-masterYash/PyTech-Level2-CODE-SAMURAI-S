Problem 5: Sales Summary Dashboard
1. Problem Chosen

The goal of this project is to create a Sales Summary Dashboard that allows users to:

Load sales data from a file.

Calculate total sales per product.

Generate a line chart showing sales trends.

Export a summary report for further analysis.

The program is designed with OOP principles and ensures that data is persisted in data.txt. It also handles invalid inputs gracefully and avoids hardcoding values.

2. Data Set Source

The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle:

Sample Sales Dataset (Data Analysis) – Kaggle

Example format of data.txt after converting Kaggle CSV to text:

Region,Product,Item Type,Sales Channel,Order Priority,Order Date,Order ID,Units Sold,Unit Price,Unit Cost,Total Revenue,Total Cost,Total Profit
Sub-Saharan Africa,Office Supplies,Binder,Offline,H,7/27/2010,669165933,440,15.57,9.67,6850.8,4254.8,2596
Middle East and North Africa,Furniture,Bookcase,Online,C,5/28/2011,963881480,25,68.84,47.99,1721,1199.75,521.25
Australia and Oceania,Technology,Smartphone,Offline,M,10/15/2012,341417157,122,780,468,95160,57096,38064

Order Priority – Priority of the order.

Order Date – Date of the order.

Units Sold, Unit Price, Unit Cost – Numeric values for sales calculations.
